API EndPoint: localhost:3000/api

Swagger OpenAPI Documentation: localhost:3000/doc/

Sources are located in the routes.js file in routes folder


Thank you so much for considering my application, please email me at arnavsin@usc.edu if there are any issues!

The main boostrap is located in index.js, with my routes/endpoints compiled in the routes/routes.js file. When the server is run locally, the port is 3000 and you can use localhost:3000/doc/ to view the Swagger API.
